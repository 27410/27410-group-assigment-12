    "    Undecylprodigiosin is a secondary metabolite belonging to the class of red-pigmented natural products known as the prodiginines, produced by a variety of bacteria, in particular Streptomyces spp, such as Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces longisporus. The group is named after prodigiosin (prodiginine) and is biosynthesized through a common set of enzymes.  Bacterial prodiginines have a long history of being remarkable multipurpose compounds, best examined for their antibacterial and antimalarial activities, and they have received renewed attention because of potential clinical interests. Undecylprodigiosin can be used as an apoptotic and anticancer agent, showing antiproliferative effects in cancer cells.  In 2007, the selective apoptotic effect of undecylprodigiosin on breast carcinoma cells was found, and consequently, it was suggested “as a novel anticancer drug for the treatment of breast cancer”. Furthermore, recent research has shown potential applications of prodiginines in the food industry as coloring agents, antioxidants, and antimicrobial additives to increase product shelf life. Production of prodigiosin in the most common producer strain Serratia marcescens has been described in great detail. Particular emphasis is put on undecylprodigiosin which has generally been a less studied member of the prodigiosin family. \n",

Streptomyces hasw a remarkably complex developmental life cycle and the capacity to produce a plethora of natural products such as anthelmintics, anticancer agents, and immunosuppressives. Today, 80% of the antibiotics are sourced from the genus Streptomyces, as the microorganisms belonging to this group have become the workhorse for genetics and a model for development and antibiotic production.  In particular, Streptomyces coelicolor are important bacteria and were sequenced because of their adaptability to environmental stress, source of bioactive molecules for medicine and industry, and relation to human pathogens. In parallel, many researchers have drawn attention to actinomycetes mainly because of their biosynthetic potential for the production of secondary metabolites, being one of the most prolific and important well-developed commercial products in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and food sectors. \n",

Furthermore, some additional disadvantages of this strain include poor genetic tractability, a high level of production of endogenous metabolites, cross-regulation, and biochemical interactions between endogenous and heterologous gene clusters.  \n",

In Streptomyces coelicolor, undecylprodigiosin is biosynthesized encoding the red gene cluster, a cluster consisting of 23 genes. In the past few years, many researchers have helped in organizing and learning more about this cluster, and nowadays, it is available in the scientific community. An alternative organism for undecylprodigiosin production could be Serratia marcescens, using the pig gene cluster, however, it seems that the red gene cluster is better defined than the pig one, and as can be seen in Figure 4, there are some red genes in undecylprodigiosin production that cannot be replaced by the pig genes, as the latter are fewer than the former. \n",

However, in order for microbial production to be a successful platform that is economically viable, the fermentation process needs to result in adequate productivity, rates, and yields.
