    "The fast-growing marine *Vibrio natriegens* is an emerging synthetic biology chassis and a promising candidate for an industrial cell factory. The bacterium possesses many desirable qualities for a cell factory making it interesting for industrial application. This includes a high growth and substrate uptake rate, metabolic diversity, genetic tractability, and tolerance against high salinity (Hoff et al. 2020). These properties could remarkably decrease production expenses and thus increase profits. *V. natriegens* belongs to the class of gammaproteobacteria, just like *E.coli*, and provides a very promising alternative to this commonly used industrial workhorse. \n",
    "\n",
    "The high growth rate of *V. natriegens* makes it highly interesting as a commercial cell factory. *V. natriegens* is reported to have the highest growth rate hitherto observed in a non-pathogenetic organism and has a generation time of less than 10 minutes (Hoffart et al. 2017). In comparison, the growth rate for *E. coli* is usually 15-20 minutes. This trait could prove very timesaving and speed up the Design, Build, Test, and Learn (DBTL) cycle for the cell factory development (Eichmann et al. 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "The metabolic diversity and requirement of high salinity of *V. natriegens* offers a remarkable potential to decrease the production costs. In industrial fermentation, the cost of water is a significant expense. *V. natriegens* is ubiquitous in the marine environment and thus thrive in high salinity. This means that seawater can be used in the fermentation process for *V. natriegens* and thus significantly reducing the expense of water. Furthermore, the marine bacterium has a high metabolic diversity and can utilize a wide range of substrates including cheap substrates such as sucrose and glycerol (Hoffart et al. 2017; Ellis et al. 2019). Using *V. natriegens* as a cell factory could thus prove very economically favorable.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently several established molecular biology techniques for *V. natriegens* including electroporation, conjugation, and CRIPSPR-Cas9 (Hoff et al. 2020). Recent studies have revealed that many methods and tools for production in *E. coli* can be applied in *V. natriegens* (Tschirhart et al. 2019; Eichmann et al. 2019). The codon usage in the two organisms are fairly similar (Hoff et al. 2020). A recent study investigated how well genetic components commonly used for *E. coli* work in *V. natriegens* (Tschirhart et al. 2019). This revealed that many of the synthetic biology tools can also be applied in the fast-growing vibrio. It has been suggested that *E. coli* tools and protocols could be a good starting point for developing more tools for *V. natriegens* (Hoff et al. 2020). This signifies that tools and methods for *V. natriegens* can hopefully be expeditiously developed for the optimization of *V. natriegens* as a cell factory.\n"

    "The natural product beta carotene is terpenoid that are naturally produced in fungi, plant and fruits. It is a colored red-orange pigment by which is it often used for food coloring in the food and beverage industry. It is also used for natural cosmetic products and besides being a pigment, it is also the most common source for provitamin A. The production of vitamin A is of interesting because vitamin A has multiple functions in the body, such as vision and the immune system. To express beta carotene in *V. natriegens*, the beta carotene pathway from Vibrio campbellii and the mevalonate (MVA) biosynthetic pathway from the Gram-positive bacterium *Lactobacillus acidophilus* were introduced to get the right precursors. \n",
    "Three pathways are relevant for beta carotene production (Figure 1). *Vibrio natriegens* already produce the important precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) through its upstream methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, but this product seems to be a bottleneck in the production of beta carotene. To solve this issue, the MVA pathway from *Lactobacillus acidophilus* is introduced and thereby more IPP is produced. IPP is then used in the beta carotene pathway from *Vibrio campbellii* to reach the final product. Beta carotene have already been experimentally heterologously expressed in *V. natriegens* and other microbial chassis with great success. By making a computed *V. natriegens* cell factory the goal is to increase the production rate of beta-carotene by model optimizing (Ellis et al. 2019).\n",

    "The market value of beta carotene has increased with the raised awareness of its properties and its health benefits. During the past years there have been an increased demand from the consumers for natural and organic products, which is why many companies have started using beta carotene as ingredients in their products. The global market size of beta carotene was 314.14 billion US dollars in 2020 and the market size is estimated to grow to 380.37 billion US dollars before 2025. In Europe, the most preferred dye in food processing is beta carotene and it is also becoming the most preferred dye in the American market. Furthermore, the Asian market are big contributors to the global beta carotene market due to the increased use of cosmetics. At the moment, the beta carotene industry is dominated by the two companies DSM N.V. and BASF SE. but they are followed by the Danish company Chr. Hansen. The increasing market value as a result of the raising demand seems to keep growing during the next many years. This makes the production of beta carotene interesting and finding a new better production organism can therefore be essential for future beta carotene production.

    "*V. natriegens* is an emerging cell factory with many attractive properties – most notable, its incredibly high growth rate. Furthermore, it can be cultivated using cheap substrates and salt water.  The latter could reduce the use of drinking water significantly and as clean drinking water is a limiting resource it can help the UN with sustainable development goal 6. *V. natriegens* has been proposed as a promising alternative to *E. coli*. However, less information and computational tools are currently available for *V. natriegens* compared to *E. coli*. It is thus highly relevant to construct a genome-scale model of this organism in order to e.g. computationally perform cell factory engineering for future use of *V. natriegens* as a cell factory. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will produce the high demanded product beta carotene in a more efficient and environmentally friendly way. Beta carotene have been used as a dye for both human and animal feed for many years. Today’s production of beta carotene is 95% chemical and 5% natural. This chemical produced beta carotene can be damaging to the environment and moreover the increased focus on human health and natural produced products demands for a more sustainable and natural production. It would therefore have an effect on the climate change mitigation to change a larger part of the chemical produced beta-carotene to bioproduced beta-carotene. To achieve this, the heterologous pathway for beta-carotene can be introduced into the marine bacterium *V. natriegens*."

This resulted in a maximum theoretical production of 0.94 mmol gDW<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>-1</sup>. Production in the *V. natriegens* model is thus more than 2-fold higher. The maximal growth rate of *V. natriegens* is also slightly higher than *E. coli* iML1515. The maximal growth rate of *V. natriegens* ended up being 0.92 h<sup>-1</sup>, and for *E. coli* iML1515 the maximal growth rate is 0.88 h<sup>-1</sup>. However, the yields of beta carotene in *V. natriegens* and *E. coli* are more or less the same at 0.094 mmol<sub>beta</sub>/mmol<sub>glc</sub> with the first difference on the fourth significant decimal."

    "The GSM model was constructed from carveme and adjusted according to experimental fluxes and uptakes found in Long *et al.* 2017. However, the growth rate obtained in this report with the newly constructed GSM model was 0.92 h<sup>-1</sup> which is significantly lower than the experimentally determined growth rate which is 1.7 h<sup>-1</sup>. It is still unknown why this is, but for further research more experimental data should be collected to adjust the GSM model even more to match the living cell. Additionally, this would likely result in an increased score of the model in the MEMOTE evaluation. Still, the consructed GSM model for *V. natriegens* yields a higher growth rate than the *E. coli* iML1515 model which had a growth rate of 0.88 h<sup>-1</sup>.\n",

    "Beta-carotene has previously been successfully expressed in *V. natriegens* and thus verifies that the heterologous expression is possible (Ellis et al. 2019). In that study, the titer of beta-carotene was approximately 0.5 mg/L without adding the MVA pathway. The beta-carotene production in *V. natriegens* was increased approximately 6-fold in LBv2 rich medium when the MVA pathway from *Lactobacillus acidophilus* NCFM was additionally introduced (Ellis et al. 2019). When the MVA-pathway was introduced into *V. natriegens*, the titer was almost 3 mg/L (Ellis et al. 2019). The titer was not calculated in this report as no volume was mentioned. However, the introduction of the MVA pathway in the constructed GSM did not result in a difference in beta carotene production rate in *V. natriegens*. The reason for this could likely be that the GSM model does not take concentrations into count when calculating the fluxes of beta-carotene, and therefore no bottleneck was observed for limiting precursors, IPP and DMAPP. \n",

    "The maximal theoretical production of beta-carotene was observed to be more than 2-fold higher in *V. natriegens* compared to when introducing the beta-carotene pathway from *V. campbellii* in the *E. coli* iML1515 model. The heterologous expression of beta-carotene in *V. natriegens* in this study was meant as a proof-of-concept to investigate if production in this host was possible. The aim was thus not to improve the yield of beta-carotene. For this reason, it might be possible to experimentally achieve a higher yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the model had an overall score of 23 % in the MEMOTE evaluation. It would thus be highly relevant to look into ways of improving the model to make it more accurately depict *V. natriegens* for its use as a cell factory. For further research, one should look into optimizing the GSM model by incorporating more experimental data with fluxes of precursors to determine the uptake and flux rates more precisely. Also, it might be necessary to do some gene knockouts for further research to obtain the experimentally determined growth rate of *V. natriegens*. \n"

    "In this work, a GSM of the emerging cell factory *V. natriegens* has been constructed, validated, and applied. The GSM was validated with experimental data from literature to improve the model and its predictions. Achieving the experimental growth rate in the GSM has not been possible so far. The constructed GSM predicted a growth rate of 0.92 h<sup>-1</sup> while an\n",
    "experimental study reported a growth rate of 1.70 h<sup>-1</sup>. The model was evaluated using MEMOTE which yielded an overall score of 22% to begin with. The GSM achieved an overall score of 23% After altering uptake rates, intracellular fluxes and deactivating certain pathways. Specifically, \"Unbound Bound Flux In Default medium\" had improved from 60.1% to 80.3%. The heterologous pathway for beta-carotene was successfully inserted and expressed in the model as proof-of-concept. The yield of beta carotene in *V. natriegens* was almost the same as *E. coli* at 0.094 mmol<sub>beta</sub>/mmol<sub>glc</sub>. The GSM predicted a maximal theoretical production of 2.02 mmol gDW<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>-1</sup> beta carotene in *V. natriegens* which is 2-fold higher than the *E. coli* iML1515 model. Furhtermore, the obtained growth rate of *V. natriegens* was slightly higher than for *E. coli*. This indicates that *V. natriegens* could be a favorable host for heterologous expression of beta carotene."
