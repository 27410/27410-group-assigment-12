# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 12 - Biosynthesis of undecylprodigiosin in Streptomyces coelicolor

## Project summary
The aim of this project is to examine different ways to obtain overproduction of undecylprodigiosin in S. coelicolor in silico using an already existing genome-scale
metabolic model (GSM). In this report, we use different cell engineering strategies for optimazing the production of undecylprodigiosin in S. coelicolor by using 
computational methods to modify the GSM model, including media optimization, alternative carbon sources, upregulation and downregulation of specific genes,
gene knockout, and co-factor swapping. 


## Project overview 
Our project is organized into different folders and notebooks. 


Our analysis of the GSM can be found in the numbered jupyter notebooks in the "Notebooks" directory.

The report is in the Report.ipynb notebook and contains links to the analysis notebooks in the "Notebooks" directory.

Pictures used in the report are stored in the "Figures" directory.

The GSM models for Streptomyces coelicolor can be found in the "Models" directory.

Requirements.txt lists all Python libraries that our notebooks depend on. 
The requirements can be installed with the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
