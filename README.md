# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 12 - Biosynthesis of undecylprodigiosin in Streptomyces coelicolor

> Dear students, thank you for accepting the group assignment. Please fill in the
> requested information below and above ([Group Number] and [TITLE]) and remove this quoted part before submission (everything prepended with a >).
> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line ðŸ‘† with the name of your repository here on GitHub.
> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
> Furthermore, this will only work if you decide to make your repository public (which you can do under Settings -> Options),
> which I would encourage you to do â€“ up to you. A lot of good science happens out in the open these days.
> Good luck!

## Project summary (<300 words)
> The aim of this project is to examine different ways to obtain overproduction of undecylprodigiosin in S. coelicolor in silico using an already existing genome-scale
> metabolic model (GSM). In this report, we use different cell engineering strategies for optimazing the production of undecylprodigiosin in S. coelicolor by using 
> computational methods to modify the GSM model, including media optimization, alternative carbon sources, upregulation and downregulation of specific genes,
> gene knockout, and co-factor swapping. 


## Project overview 
> Our project is organized into different folders and notebooks.
> Our analysis of the GSM is in the numbered notebooks in the main folder.
> The report is in the Report.ipynb notebook and contains links to the analysis notebooks in the main folder.
> Pictures used in the report are stored in the folder pictures.
> The models are found in the models folder
