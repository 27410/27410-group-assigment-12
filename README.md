# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 12 - Biosynthesis of undecylprodigiosin in Streptomyces coelicolor

## Project summary
The aim of this project is to examine different ways to obtain overproduction of undecylprodigiosin in S. coelicolor in silico using an already existing genome-scale
metabolic model (GSM). In this report, we use different cell engineering strategies for optimazing the production of undecylprodigiosin in S. coelicolor by using 
computational methods to modify the GSM model, including media optimization, alternative carbon sources, upregulation and downregulation of specific genes,
gene knockout, and co-factor swapping. 


## Project overview 
Our project is organized into different folders and notebooks. 


Our analysis of the GSM is found in "Notebooks" folder.

The report is in the Report.ipynb notebook and contains links to the analysis notebooks in the main folder.

Pictures used in the report are stored in the "Figures" folder.

Our analysis of the GSM is in the numbered notebooks in the Notebooks folder.

The report is in the Report.ipynb notebook and contains links to the analysis notebooks in the Notebooks folder.

Pictures used in the report are stored in the folder Figures.

The models are found in the "Models" folder.

Requirements.txt lists all Python libraries that our notebooks depend on. The requirements should be runned like: pip install -r requirements.txt
